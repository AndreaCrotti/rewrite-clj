# rewrite-clj

__rewrite-clj__ is a library offering mechanisms to easily rewrite Clojure/EDN documents in a whitespace- and comment-preserving
way. It includes an EDN parser (based on [clojure.tools.reader](https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader)), a corresponding
printer, as well as an EDN-aware zipper implementation (based on [fast-zip](https://github.com/akhudek/fast-zip)).

This project is similar to Christophe Grand's [sjacket](https://github.com/cgrand/sjacket). In fact, I found it hard to _use_
sjacket, partly because of the underlying data structure (a [parsely](https://github.com/cgrand/parsley)-generated tree including
unnecessary data like parentheses and maintaining values as strings instead of their Clojure pendants), but mostly because of the
missing documentation. For those with similar experiences: rewrite-clj is for you!

## Usage

__Leiningen ([via Clojars](http://clojars.org/rewrite-clj))__

```clojure
[rewrite-clj "0.3.4"]
```

__Parsing Data__

The parser relies on [clojure.tools.reader](https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader) when handling simple
tokens. It generates a structure of nested vectors whose first elements represent the kind of data
contained (`:token`, `:whitespace`, `:comment`, `:list`, ...).

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.parser :as p])
(p/parse-string "(defn my-function [a]\n  (* a 3))")
;; =>
;; [:list 
;;   [:token defn] [:whitespace " "] [:token my-function] [:whitespace " "] 
;;   [:vector [:token a]] [:whitespace "\n  "] 
;;   [:list 
;;     [:token *] [:whitespace " "] [:token a] [:whitespace " "] [:token 3]]]
```

__Printing Data__

The printer incorporates whitespaces and comments in its output.

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.printer :as prn])
(prn/print-edn (p/parse-string "(defn my-function [a]\n  (* a 3))"))
;; (defn my-function [a]
;;   (* a 3))
;; => nil
```

__EDN Zipper__

To traverse/modify the generated structure you can use rewrite-clj's whitespace-/comment-/value-aware zipper
operations, based on [fast-zip](https://github.com/akhudek/fast-zip).

```clojure
(require '[rewrite-clj.zip :as z])
(def data-string 
"(defn my-function [a] 
  ;; a comment
  (* a 3))")
(def data (z/of-string data-string))

(z/sexpr data)                       ;; => (defn my-function [a] (* a 3))
(-> data z/down z/right z/node)      ;; => [:token my-function]
(-> data z/down z/right z/sexpr)     ;; => my-function

(-> data z/down z/right (z/edit (comp symbol str) "2") z/up z/sexpr)
;; => (defn my-function2 [a] (* a 3))

(-> data z/down z/right (z/edit (comp symbol str) "2") z/print-root)
;; (defn my-function2 [a]
;;   ;; a comment
;;   (* a 3))
;; => nil
```

`rewrite-clj.zip/edit` and `rewrite-clj.zip/replace` try to facilitate their use by transparently converting
between the node's internal representation (`[:token my-function]`) and its corresponding s-expression (`my-function`).

## Sweet Code Traversal

### Example

`rewrite-clj.zip` offers a series of `find` operations that can be used to determine specific positions in the code.
For example, you might want to modify a `project.clj` of the following form by replacing the `:description` placeholder
text with something meaningful:

```clojure
(defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Enter description"
  ...)
```

Most find operations take an optional movement function as parameter. If you wanted to perform a depth-first search you'd
use `rewrite-clj.zip/next`, if you wanted to look for something on the same level as the current location, you'd employ 
`rewrite-clj.zip/right` (the default) or `rewrite-clj.zip/left`. 

Now, to enter the project map, you'd look for the symbol `defproject` in a depth-first way:

```clojure
(def data (z/of-file "project.clj"))
(def prj-map (z/find-value data z/next 'defproject))
```

The `:description` keyword should be on the same layer, the corresponding string right of it:

```clojure
(def descr (-> prj-map (z/find-value :description) z/right))
(z/sexpr descr) ;; => "Enter description"
```

Replace it, zip up and print the result:

```clojure
(-> descr (z/replace "My first Project.") z/print-root)
;; (defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
;;   :description "My first Project."
;;   ...)
;; => nil
```

### Searching the Tree

Search functions include:

- `(find zloc [f] p?)`: find the first match for the given predicate by repeatedly applying `f` to the current zipper 
  location (default movement: `rewrite-clj.zip/right`). This might return `zloc` itself. 
- `(find-next zloc [f] p?)`: find the next match for the given predicate by repeatedly applying `f` to the current zipper
  location (default movement: `rewrite-clj.zip/right`). This will not return `zloc` itself.
- `(find-tag zloc [f] t)`: uses `find` to get the first node with the given tag.
- `(find-next-tag zloc [f] t)`: uses `find-next` to get the first node with the given tag.
- `(find-token zloc [f] p?)`: like `find` but will only check `:token` nodes. The predicate is applied to the node's value.
- `(find-next-token zloc [f] p?)`: like `find-next` but will only check `:token` nodes.
- `(find-value zloc [f] v)`: uses `find` to get the first `:token` node with the given value.
- `(find-next-value zloc [f] v)`: uses `find-next` to get the first `:token` node with the given value.

### Handling Clojure Data Structures

rewrite-clj aims at providing easy ways to work with Clojure data structures. It offers functions corresponding
to the standard seq functions designed to work with zipper nodes containing said structures, e.g.:

```clojure
(def data (z/of-string "[1\n2\n3]"))

(z/vector? data)                ;; => true
(z/sexpr data)                  ;; => [1 2 3]
(-> data (z/get 1) z/node)      ;; => [:token 2]
(-> data (z/assoc 1 5) z/sexpr) ;; => [1 5 3]

(->> data (z/map #(z/edit % + 4)) z/->root-string)
;; => "[5\n6\n7]"
```

The following functions exist:

- `map`: takes a function to be applied to the zipper nodes of the seq's values, has to return the 
  modified zipper node. If a `:map` node is supplied, the value nodes will be iterated over. Returns
  the supplied node incorporating all changes.
- `map-keys`: Iterate over the key nodes of a `:map` node.
- `get`: can be applied to `:map` nodes (with a key) or `:vector`/`:list`/`:set` nodes (with a numerical index)
  and will return the desired zipper location.
- `assoc`: will replace the value at the location obtained via `get`.
- `seq?`, `map?`, `vector?`, `list?`, `set?`: check the type of the given zipper node.
